# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 1st, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Started 1st exercise for Arrays on LeetCode

**Thoughts:** This first exercise was way harded than I expected it to be.

**Link to work:** [Max Consecutive Integer](https://github.com/BrysonGreer95/LeetCode/blob/master/Arrays/MaxConsecutive/Solution.java)


### Day 2: January 2nd, 2021

**Today's Progress**: 2nd exercises for Arrays on LeetCode. Finding the number of digits in a number, i.e. 100 has 3 digits.

**Thoughts:** My first attempt at this exercise was basically a duct tape solution. It was faster than 100% of users though (not sure about this, probably because it was just nested if statements). I refactored it though for a proper solution and got "faster than 94%" so I'm happier with that. Fast but wrong doesn't equal good. Ended up working later in the day on the 'Squares of a Sorted Array' exercise.

### Day 3: January 3rd, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Worked on Arrays in LeetCode more. Didn't make a lot of results though, so thinking about taking some time later tonight to work on something fun instead.

**Thoughts:** Really trying to stay motivated so I don't just quit when things get tough. Also trying to resist looking up solutions. I want to accomplish it myself.

**Link to work:** No link today, will continue tomorrow.
