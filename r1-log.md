The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on January 1st, 2021

## Log

### R1D1 
Started on LeetCode Exercises, however it looks like this may be against the rules. Will be rethinking this today.

### R1D2
Continue LeetCode Array Exercises. Working on being honest with my code and refactoring when necessary.

### R1D3
Today was a tough one for the LeetCode problems. Thinking about taking a break for a day and coding something else. Something relaxing to get my mind off of it.
